This project is the blog (web application). There were solved the next tasks: 
1) The possibility of user registration and the procedure of authorization of the registered user.
2) In the application describe the concept of posts and comments, copies of which are stored in the database. 
3) In guest mode (before login) on the main page of the site the user sees a list of publications in reverse chronological order. After login, in this section the user has the form "Create post", and the control buttons (in each publication): "Delete" and "Edit", which deletes the corresponding publication and transition to the edit form of the corresponding publications.
In this project I learned how to work with EJB (entity, facades), servlets and JSP.
